## Additional Context

### Career Transition/Pivot?
**Not exactly a pivot, but a transition point.** Mel spent 21 years at IDEXX and was recently laid off in November 2025. She's now looking for her next opportunity and wants to position herself for senior learning experience design roles. This is a chance to:
- Showcase the depth and breadth of what she accomplished at IDEXX
- Position herself as someone who can walk into a company and make immediate impact
- Demonstrate she's kept current with modern learning technologies (not stuck in old ways)
- Show she's ready for new challenges and industries beyond veterinary software

### What Makes Mel's Background Unique?
1. **Rare combination of breadth and depth**: She's done it ALL in learning - from training delivery to instructional design to content strategy to digital adoption. Most people specialize in one area.

2. **Proven ability to deliver measurable business results**: That 94% reduction in support volume isn't just a vanity metric - that's real money saved and customers served better.

3. **21 years in ONE company, but constantly evolved**: Shows loyalty AND adaptability. She didn't just do the same job for 21 years - she was promoted multiple times and reinvented her role as technology changed.

4. **Deep healthcare/veterinary domain expertise**: Trained 2000+ veterinary professionals, understands regulated industries, knows CE certification requirements. This is valuable for healthcare tech, MedTech, or any B2B software in specialized fields.

5. **Technical + Pedagogical expertise**: She's not just a "soft skills" trainer - she trains people on complex software, troubleshooting, technical workflows. And she's not just technical - she has the ATD Master certifications proving she knows the learning science.

6. **Fast learner who embraces new technology**: Learning Service Cloud, Camtasia, and Articulate RISE in 2 months? That's impressive and shows she won't be intimidated by whatever tool stack a new company uses.

- **Music taste**: Upbeat, pop, motivational playlists. Spotify Wrapped music age: 20 (young, fresh, current)
- **Favorite artist**: P!NK (confident, authentic, powerful, fun)

- **Self-awareness**: Has a good sense of humor about herself (called her Canva attempt "gross" and "embarrassing" lol)
- **Authenticity**: Wants something that genuinely represents her, not just "looks professional"
- **Work style**: Organized, detail-oriented, but also creative and people-focused

**Portfolio Tone Implication**: Should feel like Mel - warm, energetic, confident, real. Not stuffy corporate. Not overly casual. Just authentic and approachable professional.

### Anything Else Important?
- **Mel is known for being energetic, enthusiastic, and inspiring** - this should come through in the portfolio tone
- **She's done the hard work of content migration and knowledge management** - many companies need this but don't know it yet
- **Her train-the-trainer experience positions her for leadership roles** - she can build teams, not just be an individual contributor
- **She understands the full training lifecycle** - needs analysis, design, development, delivery, evaluation (Kirkpatrick Model)
- **Wisconsin-based but trained people remotely/virtually** - she's set up for remote work if needed

### Story Arc for Portfolio
The portfolio should tell this story:
1. **Hook**: Mel solves real business problems through strategic learning design (lead with that 94% stat)
2. **Credibility**: 21 years, multiple promotions, ATD Master certifications, trained 2000+ people
3. **Versatility**: Show range of projects - eLearning, video, digital adoption, content strategy, training programs

## Notes for Development

### Content Priorities
1. **Hero/Homepage** - Nail the value proposition and first impression
2. **Case Study: Cornerstone Help Hub** - This is the flagship project with the best metrics
3. **Skills Overview** - Make it scannable and organized by category
4. **About/Story Section** - Connect the dots of her 21-year journey
5. **Other Case Studies** - eLearning courses, video production, training redesign
6. **Resume/CV Download** - Should be available but not the primary focus
7. **Contact/CTA** - Make it easy to reach out

### Known Constraints
- Need to launch fairly quickly so Mel can use it in job applications
- Working with static site on GitHub Pages (no database, backend logic)
- Need mobile-responsive design
- Should be fast-loading (important for portfolio sites)
- Need to balance comprehensiveness with not overwhelming visitors

### Open Questions to Address
- [x] ~~Does Mel have any testimonials or recommendations we can use?~~ → Not mentioned yet, still need to ask
- [ ] Are there any work samples (screenshots, video clips) beyond the live URLs?
- [x] What specific types of roles/companies is Mel targeting most? → Varies by application (Training Specialist, Instructional Designer, Onboarding roles)
- [ ] Any geographic preferences or constraints for job search?
- [x] ~~Does she want to emphasize any particular skill set more than others?~~ → Flexibility to emphasize different skills based on role type
- [x] ~~Any design preferences or colors she particularly likes/dislikes?~~ → **ANSWERED: Jewel tones (green, turquoise, burgundy), grays, blacks. Liked IDEXX's green/blue palette. Music age 20, loves upbeat/pop music (P!NK). Wants it to feel like "her on a screen"**
- [ ] Professional headshot available?
- [ ] Any awards, recognition, or notable achievements not in resume?
- [ ] What's her favorite app to use? (Will inform UI/UX preferences)
- [x] ~~Any existing portfolio attempts?~~ → Yes, made one in Canva but wasn't satisfied with it

### Design Assets Needed
- [x] ~~Hex codes from IDEXX green/blue palette~~ → **ADDED: See idexx-color-palette.md for estimated codes. Jen has exact codes for production.**
- [ ] Professional headshot
- [ ] Screenshots or samples of work beyond live URLs
- [ ] Logo or personal brand mark (if desired)
- [ ] Copy the color palette image to the project for reference

### Technical Approach Notes
- Use modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript (React might be overkill for static portfolio)
- Focus on clean, semantic markup
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts
- Consider using a minimal framework or going vanilla
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement smooth scrolling and subtle animations
- Ensure accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Fast load times are critical

### Content Strategy Notes
- Lead with outcomes and metrics, not just activities
- Use storytelling structure: Challenge → Approach → Result
- Include specific numbers wherever possible (94%, 2000+ people, 11 months earlier, etc.)
- Show range but avoid overwhelming with too many projects
- Make it skimmable - headers, short paragraphs, callout metrics
- Every project should answer: "So what? Why does this matter?"
