### More with Less: 4 Surprising Strategies That Transformed Our Business Operations

In today's business environment, the pressure is always on to do more. We strive to improve efficiency, shrink customer support queues, and get new employees up to speed faster. The default solution is often additive: hire more support agents, create more training materials, or implement more complex processes. But what if the path to massive improvement isn't about adding more, but about strategically taking away?What if the most effective solutions are actually counter-intuitive? Instead of building more, we focus on simplifying. Instead of talking more, we listen better. This isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a practical, data-backed approach to organizational transformation.This article shares four impactful takeaways from a real-world transformation that produced staggering results. We’ll explore how strategic simplification and a relentless focus on the end-user led to a 94% reduction in support chats, accelerated employee proficiency by nearly a year, and achieved the highest customer satisfaction rates in three years.

##### **1\. To Dramatically Cut Support Tickets, We Wrote**  ***Less***  **—But Smarter—Content.**

###### *Explanation*

The first major initiative involved tackling an unwieldy and outdated library of customer support documentation. The team undertook a massive project to migrate over 800 legacy help files into just 300 highly optimized knowledge-based articles, hosted on a modern WordPress website. This wasn't just a content lift-and-shift; it was a strategic consolidation designed for maximum user impact.The results of this "less is more" content strategy were immediate and dramatic. The organization achieved a  **94% reduction in chat volume** , as customers were now able to find answers on their own. This self-service success drove support case rates to a  **three-year low**  and, in turn, pushed the customer satisfaction rate (CSAT) for the Practice Information Management Software (PIMS) to a  **three-year high** .

###### *Analysis & Reflection*

The success of this initiative proves that the value of a knowledge base lies not in its volume, but in its utility. The victory was achieved not by providing more information, but by curating the  *right*  information and making it exceptionally easy to find. By optimizing articles for search and structuring them around real user needs, the system empowered customers to resolve their own issues. This demonstrates a core principle of scalability: a well-designed self-service system is infinitely more efficient than an ever-expanding support team.

##### 2\. We Got New Hires Ready Nearly a Year Faster by Scrapping Our Old Training Model.

###### *Explanation*

For years, the new hire training program was almost entirely trainer-led, accounting for 95% to 98% of the instruction. This rigid, one-size-fits-all approach was inefficient for onboarding employees into complex technical roles. To solve this, the entire program was redesigned from the ground up into a modern, blended learning model.The new program incorporated a flexible mix of self-paced digital courses, structured mentorship, and hands-on practical application. The impact on employee readiness was profound: the redesign enabled new hires to receive critical technical training  **up to 11 months earlier**  than was possible under the old model. This acceleration had significant operational benefits, minimizing negative impacts on call center service levels, dramatically improving scheduling efficiency, and  **increasing employee retention** .

###### *Analysis & Reflection*

This shift demonstrates that for complex technical roles, rigid, time-based training is inherently inefficient. A blended model that prioritizes proficiency over seat time empowers employees, accelerates their contribution to the business, and ultimately yields a more agile workforce. By providing multiple pathways to mastery, such a model respects that adults learn at different paces and through different methods, translating directly into a more capable and productive organization.

##### 3\. The Secret to Answering User Questions Was to Ask Them First.

###### *Explanation*

The incredible 94% reduction in support chats described earlier didn't happen by accident or by making educated guesses about content. The entire strategy was built on a simple but powerful foundation: user research. Before a single word of the 300 new articles was written, the team conducted extensive  **focus groups and gathered survey data**  from the two groups who mattered most: customers and support technicians.This user-centric data was the blueprint for the project. It revealed which of the 800+ legacy articles were actually critical, what terminology real users searched for, and how the new knowledge base should be structured for maximum clarity and impact. Every decision, from categorization to content, was guided by direct user feedback.

###### *Analysis & Reflection*

The 94% chat reduction was not a stroke of luck; it was the direct, predictable outcome of a strategy that began with listening. This underscores a critical lesson: the most effective support systems are not built  *for*  users but  *with*  them. Framing user research as a foundational prerequisite, rather than an optional step, is the key to transforming a content project from a simple update into a high-impact, problem-solving engine.

##### 4\. Our Learning Platform Became More Valuable After We Deleted 300 Courses.

###### *Explanation*

In parallel with other initiatives, the team tackled a common problem in corporate learning: a bloated Learning Management System (LMS). Over time, the Docebo LMS had accumulated hundreds of courses, making it difficult for users to navigate and find relevant, up-to-date material. A project was launched to reorganize, recategorize, and ultimately  **retire over 300 courses** .The explicit goal was not to reduce the amount of learning but to enhance its quality and accessibility. By removing outdated and irrelevant content, the team was able to  **improve navigation, course usability, and client access**  to the high-value resources that remained.

###### *Analysis & Reflection*

The value of a corporate learning platform is measured not by the size of its catalog, but by the speed at which an employee can find a solution. A bloated, disorganized LMS signals a disregard for the user's time and cognitive load. Strategic curation is therefore not just digital housekeeping; it is a core component of designing an efficient and respectful learning experience. The thoughtful removal of clutter is just as critical to a successful learning strategy as content creation.  
Across customer support, employee training, and digital content management, the same theme emerges: dramatic improvements often come from strategic simplification, not additive complexity. By focusing on the user, having the courage to remove what isn't working, and building systems designed for clarity, it is possible to achieve results that far exceed traditional, resource-intensive approaches.What is one area in your organization where you could achieve more by strategically doing less?
