To achieve a **94% reduction in chat volume**, Melissa Meixner Schlewitz implemented a comprehensive content migration and optimization strategy during her tenure as a Learning Experience Designer at IDEXX 1-3.  
The specific strategies used included:

* **Content Consolidation and Migration:** She managed the migration of more than **800 help files** from on-premises veterinary software into **300 optimized knowledge-based articles** 1, 2, 4\.  
* **Platform Modernization:** These articles were moved to a **WordPress website**, transitioning from older on-premise help files to a more accessible web-based format 2, 5, 6\.  
* **Search Engine Optimization:** Each article was specifically **categorized and optimized for search** to ensure users could find answers independently without needing to initiate a chat 2-4.  
* **Data-Driven Development:** Before creating the new content, she conducted **focus groups and gathered survey data** from both customers and support technicians to ensure the new articles addressed the most pressing user needs 2, 4, 5\.  
* **Integration of Digital Adoption Tools:** In addition to the knowledge base, she utilized the **WalkMe digital adoption platform** to provide proactive support through walkthroughs and tooltips, further reducing the need for direct support contact 1, 2, 7\.

This strategic overhaul not only reduced chat volume but also resulted in the **Practice Information Management Software (PIMS) satisfaction rate (CSAT) reaching a three-year high** and support case rates dropping to a three-year low 1, 2, 4\.
